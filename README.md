ParseHelpers
============

Parse iOS and OSX SDK helpers.

Feel free to fork and add any functionality that other developers may need.

NOTE: This library should support Parse OSX SDK out of the box, but didn't test it yet. If you have a real OSX project based on Parse OSX SDK - it would be great if you test this library on your project and let me know if it works well or not.
